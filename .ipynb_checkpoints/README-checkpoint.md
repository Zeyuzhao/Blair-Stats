# Blair-Stats
Notebooks for MBHS Magnet Statistics Class. 

I used `Pandas` extensively in this class, and also learned to generate nifty charts with `Seaborn`.

I also used `SciPy` and `NumPy` for their statistics and data manipulation utilities. 

## Structure

All my Python notebooks for this class are contained within `/notebooks`.
The `/notebooks` directory is organized into `Units`, and also contains some miscellaneous notebooks.
The `/data` directory contains datasets from the Statistics textbook our class uses. I also included datasets created during our class in the directory.
