# Blair-Stats
Data Science notebooks for MBHS Magnet Statistics Class. 

Used `Pandas` extensively in this class, and also learned to generate nifty charts with `Seaborn`.

Also used `SciPy` and `NumPy` for their statistics and data manipulation utilities. 

## Structure

All Python notebooks for this class are contained within `/notebooks`.
The `/notebooks` directory is organized into `Units`, and also contains some miscellaneous notebooks.
The `/data` directory contains datasets from the Statistics textbook our class uses. I also included datasets created during our class in the directory.
